This repository will house all of the documentation and code associated with the Theatre DMX projects
that I build

# DMX-Power
Build for a DMX device that will allow a DMX controller to controll 4 120 AC outlets
This build will include both 120V AC and 5V DC in a single enclosure.  We will do our
best to isolate these components in the enclosure.
